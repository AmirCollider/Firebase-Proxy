// ==========================================
// Core/Locale.js
// Where a language lives in a URL.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Every page on this site used to exist at one address and change
// language according to `?lang=`, a cookie, or an Accept-Language
// header. Read that back as a search engine does and the problem
// is immediate:
//
//   - `/`, `/?lang=fa`, `/?lang=en` and `/?lang=ja` all declared
//     the same canonical URL, `/`. An hreflang cluster whose
//     members all canonicalise to one member is not a cluster;
//     Google discards it and keeps the one URL.
//
//   - So the site had exactly one indexable address per page, and
//     the language it showed there was decided by Accept-Language.
//     Googlebot sends no Accept-Language header. `LANGUAGES.default`
//     is `fa`. Every page Google has ever indexed of this site is
//     the Persian one - which is why searching the brand from a
//     non-Persian locale finds nothing, and why the English and
//     Japanese content the site genuinely has may as well not
//     exist.
//
// The fix is the one thing that makes an hreflang cluster real:
// give every language its own URL.
//
//   fa   /about          the default language keeps the bare path
//   en   /en/about
//   ja   /ja/about
//
// A path, not a query string. `?lang=` is not itself fatal to
// ranking - but a path segment is unambiguous, survives being
// copied by hand, and cannot be dropped by anything that
// normalises query strings.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RULE THAT MAKES IT WORK
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// A bare path is ALWAYS the default language. Not "the default
// unless a cookie says otherwise" - always. That is what makes the
// address stable enough to index: one URL, one language, one set
// of bytes, for every visitor and every crawler.
//
// A human who prefers another language is redirected to that
// language's own URL (Worker.js), with a 302 rather than a 301,
// because the preference belongs to the visitor and not to the
// address.
//
// Exports
//   splitLangPath(pathname)      -> { lang, path }
//   localizedPath(path, lang)    -> '/en/about'
//   isLangRoutable(path)         -> whether a path takes a prefix
//   stripLangPath(pathname)      -> the bare path

// ==========================================
// Paths that never carry a language prefix.
//
// Two kinds, and they are here for different reasons.
//
// The machine surface (`/assets/`, `/oauth/`, `/database/`, the
// `/games/{id}/...` API) is called by shipped Android builds with
// their own HTTP stacks. Some of them do not follow redirects at
// all. Nothing about a language belongs in those addresses and
// nothing may ever redirect them.
//
// The transactional surface (`/checkout`, `/order`, `/license`) is
// left alone for a narrower reason: the payment provider is handed
// a `success_url` when an invoice is opened, and that URL is stored
// on their side for the life of the invoice. It carries `?lang=`
// and a signed order handle. Rewriting those addresses would mean a
// customer returning from a payment made yesterday lands on a
// redirect this deployment invented today. They are `noindex` and
// disallowed in robots.txt, so nothing is lost by leaving them as
// they are.
//
// Note `/games/` carries its trailing slash: `/games` exactly is
// the public catalogue page and IS language-routed.
