// ==========================================
// The ink that reads on an accent-coloured field
//
// Every filled control that is painted with the game's accent -
// the download button, the current nav tab, the pressed language
// segment, the primary action on a dashboard card - is a gradient
// from the accent toward white, and the text on top of it used to
// be a hard-coded `#fff`. That is a bet that every accent anybody ever picks is
// dark, and it loses the first time somebody picks a bright one.
//
// Chrono Blades is #20fea9, a bright mint. White on the middle
// of that gradient measures 1.28:1. The floor for readable text
// is 4.5:1, so the label was not "hard to read" - it was very
// nearly invisible, and no amount of squinting was going to fix
// it.
//
// So the ink is measured rather than assumed. Both candidates
// are scored against the MIDDLE of the gradient (the honest
// worst case for the whole button, since white text fails
// hardest at the light end) and the better one wins. A dark
// accent still gets white, exactly as before; a light one gets a
// near-black tinted with its own hue, which reads as deliberate
// rather than as a black rectangle dropped on the colour.
//
// The result is one CSS variable, so a rule can stop caring which
// case it is in. It lives in Core rather than beside one page
// because three separate chromes paint with an accent - the game
// pages, the dashboard cards and the site header - and they each
// had their own copy of the same wrong assumption.

// Reorders the items inside every <ul> so the shortest line comes
// first and the longest last.
//
// A policy page is a stack of bullet lists, and a list whose lines
// arrive in whatever order they were typed reads as ragged: a
// four-word bullet wedged between two full sentences looks like a
// mistake even when every line is correct. Sorted by length the
// block becomes a wedge, which is the shape an eye scans fastest
// and the shape the owner asked for by name.
//
// It runs at RENDER time rather than being baked into the content
// dictionaries on purpose. The same sentence is a different length
// in Persian, English and Japanese, so an order hand-sorted for one
// language is wrong in the other two - and the next person to edit
// a bullet would have to re-sort three lists by hand or silently
// break the rule. Sorting here keeps all three right, for good.
//
// Length is measured over the visible text with tags stripped, so a
// <strong> label or a link does not inflate a line, and it counts
// code points rather than UTF-16 units so an emoji or a Japanese
// character weighs one. The sort is stable: lines that measure the
// same keep the order they were authored in.
//
// Deliberately naive about nesting - it assumes a <ul> holds only
// <li> elements and no inner <ul>, which is what every list on the
// policy pages is. A nested list would be flattened into its
// parent's ordering, so if one ever appears, this needs a real
// parser rather than a regex.
